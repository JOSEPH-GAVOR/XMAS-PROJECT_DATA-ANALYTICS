Exploratory Data Analysis Project - Red Wine Dataset
Project Overview
This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a modified version of the Red Wine Dataset using the Objected-Oriented approach. The analysis will be conducted in a Jupyter Notebook environment, and the process will include data loading, basic information checking, statistical analysis, and visualization using various Python libraries.

Project Structure
The project is organized into three main sections:

Section I: Setup
Create a Folder:

Create a folder named with your index number to organize your project files.
Dataset Copy:

Copy the modified red_wine.csv dataset into the created folder.
Jupyter Notebook Server:

Start a Jupyter Notebook Server using the Command Prompt Interface.
Section II: Jupyter Notebook Tasks
Markdown Information:

Provide your name, index number, and class in a markdown cell.
Library Installation and Import:

Install and import the necessary Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy).
Dataset Loading and Preview:

Import the modified red_wine.csv dataset.
Preview the first 10 rows using the head method.
Preview the last 20 rows using the tail method.
Basic Information and Statistical Analysis:

Use the info method to check basic information on the dataset.
Use the describe method to obtain statistical information on the dataset.
Data Visualization:

Deploy various skills and techniques, including graphs and plots, to obtain meaningful insight from the dataset.
Markdown Reporting:

Use markdown cells to report on all plots and graphs obtained.
Section III: Git Repository
Local Git Repository:

Create a local Git repository and commit your work to the repository.
Remote GitHub Repository:

Create a remote GitHub repository and commit your work to the remote repository.
Submission:

Copy the link of your remote GitHub repository and include it in the provided Google form.
Submission
Submission Date: 07-Jan-2024
